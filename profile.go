// A platform profile fills in a destination, so declaring one names a platform
// instead of restating four facts about it.
//
// The machinery to serve a platform already existed before this file: the
// installer writes atomically, validates the configuration before committing to
// it, reloads the service and rolls back from a captured copy if the reload
// fails. What was missing was any statement of *which* platforms that covers.
// An operator evaluating CertPilot for a Tomcat estate read "there is an agent"
// and had to work it out for themselves, and the honest answer was "yes, if you
// write the spec by hand".
//
// So a profile is four fields — a path, a format, a check command and a reload
// command — and everything else already exists.
//
// # A profile is a default, not a lock
//
// Estates move paths. Every field a profile supplies is one the operator may
// write down themselves, and theirs wins; the profile fills only what was left
// blank. A profile that could not be overridden would be worse than no profile,
// because it would look supported while writing to somewhere nothing reads.
//
// # Detection does not imply support
//
// [Profile.Detect] says what to look for on a host that runs this platform. It
// answers "does this file exist", and that is all it answers. It does not mean
// the paths in this profile are the ones the service is reading — the service
// reads whatever its configuration says, and inventory.go's parser for that
// calls itself a heuristic and openly so. Detection is a prompt for a human,
// never a decision the agent makes on its own.
//
// # Every profile here has been installed to
//
// Not unit-tested: run. scripts/verify-profiles.sh starts the real service in a
// container, installs a certificate through this agent's own installer, runs
// this profile's check and reload, and completes a TLS handshake against the
// running service to prove it is serving that certificate. A profile nobody
// ran is a claim, and this issue exists because unverified assets are how a
// quickstart came to describe a Dockerfile nobody had built.
