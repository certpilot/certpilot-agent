package agent

// Installing into the Windows certificate store.
//
// Everything else this installer does is a file: render the bytes, capture what
// was there, write, check, reload, and put the old bytes back if anything went
// wrong. IIS does not read a file. It binds a certificate by thumbprint out of
// LocalMachine\My, and so do Exchange, ADFS, Network Policy Server and Remote
// Desktop Services. On those hosts an agent that writes flawless PEM to a path
// is an agent that installs nothing.
//
// So a destination may name a store instead of paths, and three things about it
// are different enough to be worth stating.
//
// # There is no check
//
// Every other destination runs a check before the reload, and that line is the
// difference between a bad certificate being a rolled-back non-event and an
// outage. There is no `nginx -t` for a certificate store: nothing on Windows
// will tell you in advance whether a binding you have not made yet will work.
//
// Rather than pretend, this offers the other half of the same guarantee —
// `verify`, which connects to the endpoint after the binding and confirms the
// certificate being served is the one just installed. It is an *after* check, so
// a failure means something was briefly wrong rather than never wrong, and it is
// the strongest honest thing available here. A destination that declares no
// verify has no check at all, and that is said plainly rather than implied.
//
// # The binding is a command, because there are five of them
//
// IIS binds by thumbprint against a site binding; Exchange takes
// Enable-ExchangeCertificate with a service list; ADFS, NPS and RDS each have
// their own cmdlet. Teaching the agent all five would be five things to keep
// current, and it would still be wrong for the sixth.
//
// What it does instead is import the certificate, work out its thumbprint, and
// run the command this host's administrator wrote down with the thumbprint
// substituted into it — exactly the relationship it already has with `reload`.
// The `iis` profile supplies that command so the common case is one word, and
// the uncommon ones are one line rather than unsupported.
//
// # Rollback has to be built, not inherited
//
// A file destination rolls back by writing back bytes it captured. A store has
// no equivalent: importing does not displace anything, so there is nothing to
// capture, and the thing that actually changed is which thumbprint the binding
// names.
//
// The previous thumbprint is therefore recorded, and it is recorded in the store
// itself rather than in a state file beside the agent. Every certificate this
// agent imports is given the friendly name "CertPilot: <destination>", which
// makes the question "which certificate did I last install here" answerable by
// reading the store — by this agent, and by whoever opens certlm.msc and wants
// to know which of the certificates in it are ours.
